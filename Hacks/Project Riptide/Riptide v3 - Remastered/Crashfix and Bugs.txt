1. Please Inject in Main Menu - Don't Inject Ingame it will probably crash
2. Disable features in Misc Visuals (Bulletbeams, Hitmarker, Damage Indicator)
3. Remove the Riptide folder in C:/
4. Remove all Configs for Riptide
5. Don't load your Configs ingame. Load your Configs in Main Menu
6. Remove Junkcode (Riptide is heavy and crashs with to much code)
7. Change your Injector (Use Extreme Injector for testing)
8. Create a Config before you save one
9. Update your Windows SDK Version
10. Download Windows DirectX SDK

KNOWN BUGS:
- Anti Aim crashs the game on slow computers (sometimes)
- Ragebot shoots at the Bottom or in the air - Restart your Computer the Ragebot needs some CPU and Memory power (try to disable RCS for AutoSniper / Awp / SSG - NoRecoil). Also may offsets have changed so update the cheat yourself.
- Ragebot sometimes only works with Autosniper Awp and SSG or Pistols.. I will fix the Offsets maybe.
